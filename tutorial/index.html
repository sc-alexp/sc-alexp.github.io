    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <i>In a time long long ago in a room not far away, in a time when dinosaurs
      roamed the earth, <code>sc_alexp</code> learned from
      <code>sc_nickv</code> that ServiceNow is able to
      <b>parse HTML in the Additonal comments/Work notes fields</b>!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not able to do it with no help, however! <i>There is a trick!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for ServiceNow to parse the html in a message, it must be
      surrounded by the proper tags.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>HTML that will not be rendered in Additonal comments:</p>
    <div class="text-monospace border bg-body-tertiary rounded p-3">
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://iastate.edu/&quot;&gt;Iowa State
      University&lt;/a&gt;
    </div>
    <br />
    <p>
      HTML that <b><i>will</i></b> be rendered in Additonal comments:
    </p>
    <div class="text-monospace border bg-body-tertiary rounded p-3">
      <b>[code]</b>&lt;a href=&quot;https://iastate.edu/&quot;&gt;Iowa State
      University&lt;/a&gt;<b>[/code]</b>
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <p><i>"Well that's cool and all, but I don't know HTML"</i></p>
    <p>I have good news for you! <b>That is what this tool is for!!</b></p>
    <br /><br />
    <h2>Formatting your response for a ticket</h2>
    <p>
      At the main page of this site, you will find the editor. You can change
      how it arranged using the <i class="bi bi-square"></i> and
      <i class="bi bi-layout-split"></i> buttons at the bottom. Either way your
      screen will be split into two halves.
    </p>
    <h3>The Preview</h3>
    <p>
      You will never interact with the preview, but it is a good indicator of
      what your response will look like to the customer. It updates in real time
      as you edit your response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that this is a different website with different code than
      ServiceNow, it may not be 100% accurate in every case but I have found
      that it is very reliable. It may also change over time as ServiceNow
      updates but use your own discretion.
    </p>
    <h3>The Editor</h3>
    <p>
      The star of the show. The editor in this tool is basically a fancy custom
      <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
        >markdown</a
      >
      parser. The buttons will apply markdown syntax (whenever possible) and you
      will see the rendered result in the preview.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger d-flex align-items-center" role="alert">
      <i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill"></i>
      <div class="ms-3">
        <b>Never</b> copy or paste directly from the editor or the preview. This
        will result in your message not being rendered correctly and being
        <b>confusing for the caller</b>.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you are ready to copy your message into a ticket, always use the
      green
      <span class="fw-bold text-success"
        ><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i> Copy for Ticket</span
      >
      button. This will properly format your response so that ServiceNow renders
      it to the caller.
    </p>
    <h4>Buttons</h4>
    <p>
      For most buttons with the text you want to alter, you first
      <b>select the text</b> and then click the button to alter it how you want,
      the same as you would in any normal text editor. I recommend you
      experiment, try adding a link, try bolding text.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <p>
      To better standardize and increase quickness in response times, there are
      a few basic templates that define basic formats for replies and work
      notes. You can find these by clicking
      <a href="/templates" target="_blank"
        ><i class="bi bi-file-earmark-text"></i> Templates</a
      >
      in the navbar at the top of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find the template you want, and click <b>Use this Template</b>. This will
      take you back to the editor with the template autofilled and ready for you
      to edit!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you refresh, it will reapply the template but remove your changes. To
      get rid of the template, simply click the
      <i class="bi bi-x-lg"></i> button to clear the text field and current set
      template.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any template ideas, let me know!
      <i
        >Note these templates will never have any information of substance in
        them, and they are only for basic formatting of responses.</i
      >
